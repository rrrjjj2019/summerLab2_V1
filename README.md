- Original version: neural network architucture is eCNN hetergeneous model V1(At branch master).
- Version 1: delete layer conv8 (At branch delete_layer_conv8).
- Version 2 :delete layer FC11 (At branch delete_a_FC_layer).<br>
Note: I only modify RGB neural network architucture, DEPTH isn't modified.
